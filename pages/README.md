Note
----

When files with ``.handlebars`` extension changed, all site pages will be
re-assembled. These pages may contain content that is available only when
the site is built with all pages.

When files with ``.hbs`` extension changed, only pages within this directory
will be re-assembled.

There is no difference of these files in production mode.

See watch and assemble section in Gruntfile.js for more information.
